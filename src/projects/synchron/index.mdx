Synchron is a narrative driven puzzle game set in a science fiction universe currently in development.

It is being developped by a team of two in which I work as Game designer, Lead programer, Technical Artist, Level designer, UI Designer and Lead QA
Gameplay.

Synchron gameplay relies on controling two characters simultaneously using a controller splitted in two (one side per character).

Both characters possess unique abilities that you must use in synergy in order to solve challenging puzzles.

Gameplay is ponctuated by narrative sequences that tell a original science fiction / cosmic horror story.
